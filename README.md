# Responsive Website using JavaScript CSS and HTML

This project utilizes responsive web design with 2 breakpoints using a "mobile-first" approach.  Each breakpoint reorgainzes the code and breakpoints were selected for readability.

## CSS
Since it is a small project, i did not use reusable variables as a way to keep the code simple.

I used CSS to create a drop-down menu that is visible in smaller screens and hidden after 700px.  

## HTML
I wrote the code with contemporary conventions in mind trying to make the code as readable and organized as possible.  

## JavaScript
I used two JavaScript Components

### Click
the onCLick eventListener was used for the button to control the dropdown menu

### Scroll
This will cause the navigation menu to appear on scroll up and disapear on scroll down.  I wanted this to listen to each position on the Y-Axis to ensure the menu appears immediately on scroll up.
